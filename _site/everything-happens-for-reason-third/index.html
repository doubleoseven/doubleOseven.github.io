Now this friend of his had a habit of analyzing any situation whether it be good or bad and commenting on it by saying, "This is good, God knows best". Now it just so happens that one day, the king and his friend are on a hunting trip - the friend who is in charge of loading the guns hands the king his gun and when the king fires, &nbsp;the gun backfires cutting off his thumb. The friend immediately comments on this by saying, "This is good. God knows best" The king who is standing there thumbless, is enraged by his friends words and yells, "No. It is not!" and orders his soldiers to put the friend in jail.<o:p></o:p></b></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="background-color: white; font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;"><b><br /></b></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="background-color: white; font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;"><b>&nbsp; A &nbsp;year later the king is yet on another hunting trip this time in an area which is unexplored and it's just his luck that a group of cannibals capture him and take him back to their tribe. Now just when they're about to prepare the fire and wood, they notice the missing thumb. Being very superstitious people who refuse to eat anything that isn't whole, they untie the king and drive him out of the village. The king surprised at this, remembers his good friend and upon returning to his kingdom immediately goes to visit him in jail. Standing in front of him, he apologizes to his friend saying, "You were right, it was a good think that I lost my thumb, I am sorry for everything, and it was extremely wrong of me to sentence you to a year in jail" To this the friend smiles and replies. "No it was a good thing". The king opens his mouth to object, when the friend continues. "If I had&nbsp; NOT been sentenced to jail, I would certainly have been with you on that hunting trip"<o:p></o:p></b></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="background-color: white; font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;"><b><br /></b></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="background-color: white; font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;"><b>&nbsp; Fellow Toastmasters, honorable guests, good evening. The thing is, a lot of the time we don't understand the wisdom behind why something happens the way it does. Especially in the case of something which we view as being bad, tragic, or harmful in some way. It could be an exam that you failed in, a relative who passed away, being accused of something&nbsp; which you are completely innocent off, or even a physical accident. Most of the time we ask ourselves questions like, "Why me?" or "Why is this happening" and we have feelings of disappointment and regret &nbsp;but what we don't realize is that this is what was supposed to happen and it is actually something that will benefit us in some way. <o:p></o:p></b></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="background-color: white; font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;"><b><br /></b></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="background-color: white; font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;"><b>&nbsp; Although initially I was going to give a more personal example I've decided to give a historical one instead for one reason: history is filled with stories many of which contain amazing &nbsp;lessons which we can all benefit from and use in times of need. My favorite one being the story of Prophet Yusuf(peace and blessing be upon him) because although he was a messenger of God, one of the best of creations he too went through difficult times just like any of us. &nbsp;<o:p></o:p></b></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="background-color: white; font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;"><b><br /></b></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: white; font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;"><b><span style="font-size: small;">&nbsp; </span>If we look at Prophet Yusuf's story we can see it is full of hardships&nbsp; one after another not only for Prophet Yusuf but for his family as well. &nbsp;From the very beginning of the story you have a young &nbsp;boy - being thrown into a well by his own brothers out of their hatred and&nbsp;jealousy&nbsp;for him and is left to die. You have his father who believes him dead and therefore loses his eyesight out of grief.&nbsp; And although the boy is rescued and sold as a slave, he is later accused of seducing the wife of the very man who bought him&nbsp; thus sentencing him to years in jail. However, if you fast-forward to the end of the story: not only does the boy become the king of Egypt's chief minister and is known for his gift of interpreting dreams but he is also given a position of power, authority and wealth, and the king even goes on to prove his innocence and removes all charges against him. And as the story progresses, Prophet Yusuf is reunited with his eleven brothers who apologize for their mistake, his parents and his father even gains his eyesight again. <o:p></o:p></b></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="background-color: white; font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;"><b><br /></b></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="background-color: white; font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;"><b>&nbsp; Now if you look at the sequential order of the story you can see that one thing led up to another. In order for Prophet Yusuf to reach the position that he was in the end he go to through <i>each</i> and <i>every</i> one of those incidents&nbsp; - in order for the king to realize his talent of interpreting dreams and for him to gain that position of authority , he had to be put into jail. For him to be put into jail in the first place he had to be thrown into the well so that he could be sold to the Aziz family.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></b></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="background-color: white; font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;"><b><br /></b></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="background-color: white; font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;"><b>&nbsp;<i>So everything that happened, happened for a reason. </i><o:p></o:p></b></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="background-color: white; font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;"><b><br /></b></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="background-color: white; font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;"><b>&nbsp; As long as you are doing your best, no matter what happens: even if the situation seems so utterly hopeless - remember the story of Prophet Yusuf and what <i>he</i> went through in order to get to where he was in the end. <o:p></o:p></b></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="background-color: white; font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;"><b><br /></b></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: white; font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;"><b><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp; You see, &nbsp;just because you can't see the point of something until after it has happened that doesn't mean&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">there isn't a reason.

Other than the fact it's a spectacular movie which I could watch a hundred times (just like I did with all three parts of LOTR - man, I really can't get how ANYONE could call them boring) and still not get tired of it - the rest of my siblings hadn't seen it yet. But when my younger brother walked in while I sat at my laptop watching a tutorial on HTML coding and announced that everyone was waiting for me to come join them, I have to admit, I was initially kind of annoyed. I really don't like being disturbed especially when I'm in that mood for learning (which isn't very often - usually I'd prefer to just curl up and go to sleep). Before I could tell him to leave me alone and go away, I&nbsp; stopped for a second and reconsidered the relationship we have as siblings. Alhamdulilah, I could say I am very blessed indeed to be very close to my siblings - we share a bond that is thicker than blood - an unbreakable bond. Don't get me wrong, we most certainly have our ups and downs (you really don't want to see us get into a fight - I'm warning you, it's not pretty) but there is that understanding, that connection we share knowing we'd be there for each other when no one else is. </b></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b style="background-color: white;"><br /></b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b style="background-color: white;">&nbsp; &nbsp;I'm sure a lot of people have the same relationship with their siblings (I could be wrong though) - but I've realized that this connection isn't something that was just there - it was developed through little things such as watching a movie together, or sharing popcorn, or even discussing a favorite book. As trivial as these things may seem, it's what brings people closer. And it's certainly what brings us together. These opportunities that we are given to spend time with one other should not be wasted away, or considered unimportant but rather they should be held close to our heart and treasured for all times. </b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b style="background-color: white;"><br /></b></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><b style="background-color: white;">&nbsp; &nbsp;We may not share the same personalities, or have the same outlook on things but what we do share is enough for us to put aside our differences and accept each other for who we are: a family.</b></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><br /></div></div>

No matter where I searched - in my very messy closet, on my cluttered dressing table or even underneath the covers of my bed - I just couldn't find it. "How could a book that noticeable just ... disappear?" - "I must have dropped it on my way out of the car" "Or perhaps I left it at my grandparents place?" These were the thoughts that kept swirling through my head the entire time. A constant reminder that I was missing something and that if I didn't find it&nbsp; as soon as possible, I was a goner. A number was dialed and my grandmother picked up on the other end. "No, dear, your book isn't here". I sighed as I placed the receiver back down. Every time I would rack my memory for the exact place where I had left the book when I had come home - I would be greeted with a black empty space and a headache. </b></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><b style="background-color: white;"><br /></b></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><b style="background-color: white;">The book seemed to have vanished.&nbsp; Or at least that's the story I went with seeing as there was no other explanation. </b></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><b style="background-color: white;"><br /></b></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><b style="background-color: white;">&nbsp;***</b></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><b style="background-color: white;"><br /></b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b style="background-color: white;">The next day I walked towards my professor's office: twiddling my fingers as I knocked on her door and was welcomed in with a huge smile and a gesture to have a seat. My professor who can see right through me, knew this wasn't a spontaneous visit which is usually the case. I promptly related to her the entire situation, starting with the visit to my grandparent's place and ending with the disappearance of my German book. </b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b style="background-color: white;"><br /></b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;"><i><b style="background-color: white;">"It's gone.
