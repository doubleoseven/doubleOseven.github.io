  <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div class="MsoNormal"><i>A short story I've been writing for a while, just for fun. Haven't finished it yet but I thought if I posted it on my blog, I might be motivated to do so. Hope you enjoy it and comments are more than welcome. :)</i><br /><hr /><br /><br />Lightning crashed - hitting the earth above him and he trembled from the very thought of accidentally letting go. The world around him was a mixture of electric blue and gray swirling collectively in the pouring heavy rain as he hung off the edge of the cliff desperately clinging for his life. His clothes were drenched; rainwater running in rivulets from his dark hair and through the creases in his shirt. He grit his teeth as he pushed his hands against the moist soil - using all his strength in his attempt to pull himself up. Beads of sweat mixed with water trickled down his forehead; his breath came out in short spasms and fear shone clearly though his bluish-green eyes. Above him the sound of the rain as it pounded the earth could be heard echoing through the darkness wrapped around him. He was terrified; and yet all the strength in the world could not assist in saving him from what was his doom. His fragile heart beat hard against his chest and he felt as if he were drowning in this sheet of rain that seemed to envelop him in a deathly embrace. There was a clap of thunder and a lightning bolt lit up the yawning night sky and suddenly he felt a searing pain escalate throughout his entire body. He gasped in response unable to withstand the pain that made him feel as if his very veins were on fire. His unoccupied hand reached up to rub his temples as a quiet moan escaped his lips "Why? Why me? What have <i>I d</i>one to deserve this?".</div><div class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">The sound of the rain subsided and it was then that a deep low voice responded to him from within the darkness shaking the very platform on which he clutched onto with his dear life. "Shall I show you?" The man, taken by surprise frantically turned his head towards the direction of the voice trying to pinpoint its location. "Who are you?"He shouted uneasily into the void. "I am the guardian of this wretched place" "Guardian?" "Yes. Long ago the souls of the dead would be brought here to be punished by the command of Master Hades. Over the years, the humans stopped worshiping the great Kings - Zeus, Poseidon and Hades and with each passing year the power of the Olympians diminished. With Hades no longer the King of the Underworld - the souls had no obligation to recompense for the crimes they had committed during their lives - they merely passed on - turning into dust and vanishing" Confused, the man shook his head "If the souls become dust upon death - why am I still here?" "Your questions shall be answered in time. For now, let me show you" The voice trailed off like a shadow trailing in the dust. "Show me what?" The man's voice was hoarse - his breathing ragged and hot against his hand. The voice didn't respond.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal">Time passed. Seconds? Minutes? Hours? By now the man felt an inner desire to let go - to let go and plummet into the hands of whatever fate had stored for him. His entire body throbbed - his arms ached and his heart had not ceased to pound fiercely against his chest. It was then that from within the grayish-blue chaos a lightning bolt crashed into the edge of cliff - exceedingly close to where the man clung onto with his slowly diminishing strength. Electric blue sparks sprung from the impact and landed on his hand causing him to howl out in pain and agony. His hand slipped - the pain being too much to bear and before he knew it he was falling into the bottomless void that lay below him.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">To be continued ...&nbsp;</div></div>

          <h2 class="post-title-link"><a href="/coherence-in-quran">Coherence in the Quran:</a></h2>
          <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">&nbsp; The Quran has 114 Surahs (I will translate that to 'chapters' at the moment) – all of which were revealed at different times and these Surahs are divided into two categories:<div><ol style="text-align: left;"><li><span style="font-size: 7pt; text-indent: -0.25in;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span dir="LTR" style="text-indent: -0.25in;"></span><span style="text-indent: -0.25in;">Makki Surahs (Surahs revealed in Makkah - the main audience were the Quraish – most Ayat are an introduction to Allah, His signs, Paradise, Hell Fire and the Day of Judgment)</span></li><li><span style="text-indent: -0.25in;">Madani Surahs (Surahs revealed in Madinah, the main audience were the Muslims)</span></li></ol></div><div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; text-indent: -.25in;"><o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; The Quran starts with Surah Al Fatihah and ends with Surah Al Naas – at first glance, one may wonder what kind of order the Surahs in the Quran are in? The word Surah, although normally translated in English to “chapter” does not properly explain the word Surah. The word Surah was used in the olden days to refer to the outer walls of a city inside which you had many things going on all of which were connected. So with that in mind, let’s discuss some of the possibilities.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; Clearly the Quran is not in chronological order: for if it was, the first Surah would be Surah&nbsp;Al-Alaq (which in fact is placed near the end).&nbsp;It is not in size order either (Biggest Surah first and smallest last) because then the last Surah would have been Surah Al Kauthar which is not the case. And neither is it in subject order with for example, Taqwa (piety) discussed first, Eman (faith) second etc. nor does it deal with a single subject matter one at a time. The conclusion many may eventually arrive to is that seeing as each Surah is independent of each other, there must not be a connection. Many scholars believe that this is not the case (for concrete reasons that are too long to go into at the moment): just as the order of each Ayah is set by Allah, the order of each Surah in the Quran is also according to Him. With this knowledge they studied the order of the Surahs in-depth and found many beautiful connections between the Surahs and here I will share with you just one such finding. In Surah Ar- Rahman and Surah Al Waqiah, (the 55<sup>th</sup>and 56<sup>th</sup> Surahs in the Quran), one of the connections between them can be seen when listing the subjects discussed in each Surah.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>55- Surah Ar-Rahman -</b></div><div class="MsoNormal">Subjects discussed in order:<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">1) Greatness of the Quran (Ayat (signs) in the Book)<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">2) List of Allah's favors (Ayat (signs) around you.)<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">3) What happens to people who fail to be grateful?

I need to go out and get some physical exercise. All this cleaning and shopping seriously isn’t for me. I mean come on. Just the other day I ended up buying myself a pair of pink shoes. Me. Buying pink shoes. I don’t even like shoes. Or at least I pretend I don’t. *sigh*</div><div class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;">***<o:p></o:p></div><div align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">This is my attempt to blog while I’m here in the States.

You’ve probably guessed by now that we’ve done a lot of shopping – and you’ll be surprised to know a lot of food shopping. There are actually a lot of Halal food stores here. Pretty convenient, huh? The first time we walked into a grocery store, which happened to be Kroger’s; we ended up spending around a hundred dollars. On food. &nbsp;That’s what happens when you send a bunch of fasting kids into a grocery store and everything looks so good. We did end up having to check everything we picked up for the letters UD or kosher (which is as halal as stuff gets over here). This lead to loud whispers across the aisles asking if the chocolate chip cookies cookies we’d picked up were Halal or not. Unfortunately, we couldn’t find kosher bread but upon asking two of the staff members there, they kindly redirected us to a Kroger’s that did sell kosher bread. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;">***<o:p></o:p></div><div align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Have I also mentioned that people here are genuinely nice? As we were leaving Kroger’s, a young boy of ten or eleven, stopped while passing by just to say “Asalamualaikum”.&nbsp; Another lady at Macy’s greeted us the same way. People keep asking where we’re from and every time I mention Saudi, they usually mention a relative or friend they know living there. A guy at Target came up to us while we were looking at bed sheets and after finding out we’re from Saudi, stated that he was learning Arabic and greeted us with “Kaifahaluk?”. We ended up having a mini Arabic lesson right then and there. Personally, I think it’s great that people are so warm towards us. That isn’t to say that people don’t stare and look at us weird when we first walk into any store. But I'd like to think they’re more curious than anything else.&nbsp;</div><div align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;">Here’s the view from outside our apartment:<o:p></o:p></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-laCNpS4kNU8/U7w3_svm5QI/AAAAAAAAAKU/W0HblGPcqXM/s1600/10463052_10152535439211101_9104578051691376053_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-laCNpS4kNU8/U7w3_svm5QI/AAAAAAAAAKU/W0HblGPcqXM/s1600/10463052_10152535439211101_9104578051691376053_n.jpg" height="240" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">Random Louisville pictures:</div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-MGxYhCf4WHI/U7w4AlcCqzI/AAAAAAAAAKc/9tYxnj4TNo4/s1600/10511340_10152527956936101_7422537780337543532_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-MGxYhCf4WHI/U7w4AlcCqzI/AAAAAAAAAKc/9tYxnj4TNo4/s1600/10511340_10152527956936101_7422537780337543532_n.jpg" height="240" width="320" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5nHn4o0Kx4Q/U7w4CwkWHCI/AAAAAAAAAKk/3flyBUTnPCo/s1600/10514475_10152527957276101_120263596262334375_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5nHn4o0Kx4Q/U7w4CwkWHCI/AAAAAAAAAKk/3flyBUTnPCo/s1600/10514475_10152527957276101_120263596262334375_n.jpg" height="320" width="320" /></a></div><div class="MsoNormal"><o:p><br /></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><o:p><br /></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-align: center;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Congrats, I actually managed to write 500+&nbsp;words. *Gives self a cookie*</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-align: center;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Oops, I'm fasting.&nbsp;</span></div></div>
