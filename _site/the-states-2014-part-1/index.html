  <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div class="MsoNormal">It’s like there’s a huge block in my head that’s preventing me from writing. I feel stupid. I need to go out and get some physical exercise. All this cleaning and shopping seriously isn’t for me. I mean come on. Just the other day I ended up buying myself a pair of pink shoes. Me. Buying pink shoes. I don’t even like shoes. Or at least I pretend I don’t. *sigh*</div><div class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;">***<o:p></o:p></div><div align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">This is my attempt to blog while I’m here in the States. Initially, I wanted to record everything that happened on this trip and post it on my blog. Kind of like a written vlog. But that hasn't seemed to work out *see previous post* I’m going to blame the lack of exercise and overeating.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;">***</div><div align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-align: left;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-align: left;">I know it’s Ramadan and I should be directing my energy to reading Quran and praying but for some reasons I don’t feel like doing anything. All I want to do is sleep and sleep and sleep.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;">***<o:p></o:p></div><div align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">So far, I've written two tiny posts. It seems I’m doing quite well as long as I keep my posts short. Extremely short. Did I mention I feel stupid? <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;">***<o:p></o:p></div><div align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">So I guess I should mention some of the places we’ve been to in the past week here in Louisville. You’ve probably guessed by now that we’ve done a lot of shopping – and you’ll be surprised to know a lot of food shopping. There are actually a lot of Halal food stores here. Pretty convenient, huh? The first time we walked into a grocery store, which happened to be Kroger’s; we ended up spending around a hundred dollars. On food. &nbsp;That’s what happens when you send a bunch of fasting kids into a grocery store and everything looks so good. We did end up having to check everything we picked up for the letters UD or kosher (which is as halal as stuff gets over here). This lead to loud whispers across the aisles asking if the chocolate chip cookies cookies we’d picked up were Halal or not. Unfortunately, we couldn’t find kosher bread but upon asking two of the staff members there, they kindly redirected us to a Kroger’s that did sell kosher bread. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;">***<o:p></o:p></div><div align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Have I also mentioned that people here are genuinely nice? As we were leaving Kroger’s, a young boy of ten or eleven, stopped while passing by just to say “Asalamualaikum”.&nbsp; Another lady at Macy’s greeted us the same way. People keep asking where we’re from and every time I mention Saudi, they usually mention a relative or friend they know living there. A guy at Target came up to us while we were looking at bed sheets and after finding out we’re from Saudi, stated that he was learning Arabic and greeted us with “Kaifahaluk?”. We ended up having a mini Arabic lesson right then and there. Personally, I think it’s great that people are so warm towards us. That isn’t to say that people don’t stare and look at us weird when we first walk into any store. But I'd like to think they’re more curious than anything else.&nbsp;</div><div align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;">Here’s the view from outside our apartment:<o:p></o:p></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-laCNpS4kNU8/U7w3_svm5QI/AAAAAAAAAKU/W0HblGPcqXM/s1600/10463052_10152535439211101_9104578051691376053_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-laCNpS4kNU8/U7w3_svm5QI/AAAAAAAAAKU/W0HblGPcqXM/s1600/10463052_10152535439211101_9104578051691376053_n.jpg" height="240" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">Random Louisville pictures:</div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-MGxYhCf4WHI/U7w4AlcCqzI/AAAAAAAAAKc/9tYxnj4TNo4/s1600/10511340_10152527956936101_7422537780337543532_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-MGxYhCf4WHI/U7w4AlcCqzI/AAAAAAAAAKc/9tYxnj4TNo4/s1600/10511340_10152527956936101_7422537780337543532_n.jpg" height="240" width="320" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5nHn4o0Kx4Q/U7w4CwkWHCI/AAAAAAAAAKk/3flyBUTnPCo/s1600/10514475_10152527957276101_120263596262334375_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5nHn4o0Kx4Q/U7w4CwkWHCI/AAAAAAAAAKk/3flyBUTnPCo/s1600/10514475_10152527957276101_120263596262334375_n.jpg" height="320" width="320" /></a></div><div class="MsoNormal"><o:p><br /></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><o:p><br /></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-align: center;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Congrats, I actually managed to write 500+&nbsp;words. *Gives self a cookie*</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-align: center;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Oops, I'm fasting.&nbsp;</span></div></div>

          <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div class="MsoNormal"><i>A short story I've been writing for a while, just for fun. Haven't finished it yet but I thought if I posted it on my blog, I might be motivated to do so. Hope you enjoy it and comments are more than welcome. :)</i><br /><hr /><br /><br />Lightning crashed - hitting the earth above him and he trembled from the very thought of accidentally letting go. The world around him was a mixture of electric blue and gray swirling collectively in the pouring heavy rain as he hung off the edge of the cliff desperately clinging for his life. His clothes were drenched; rainwater running in rivulets from his dark hair and through the creases in his shirt. He grit his teeth as he pushed his hands against the moist soil - using all his strength in his attempt to pull himself up. Beads of sweat mixed with water trickled down his forehead; his breath came out in short spasms and fear shone clearly though his bluish-green eyes. Above him the sound of the rain as it pounded the earth could be heard echoing through the darkness wrapped around him. He was terrified; and yet all the strength in the world could not assist in saving him from what was his doom. His fragile heart beat hard against his chest and he felt as if he were drowning in this sheet of rain that seemed to envelop him in a deathly embrace. There was a clap of thunder and a lightning bolt lit up the yawning night sky and suddenly he felt a searing pain escalate throughout his entire body. He gasped in response unable to withstand the pain that made him feel as if his very veins were on fire. His unoccupied hand reached up to rub his temples as a quiet moan escaped his lips "Why? Why me? What have <i>I d</i>one to deserve this?".</div><div class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">The sound of the rain subsided and it was then that a deep low voice responded to him from within the darkness shaking the very platform on which he clutched onto with his dear life. "Shall I show you?" The man, taken by surprise frantically turned his head towards the direction of the voice trying to pinpoint its location. "Who are you?"He shouted uneasily into the void. "I am the guardian of this wretched place" "Guardian?" "Yes. Long ago the souls of the dead would be brought here to be punished by the command of Master Hades. Over the years, the humans stopped worshiping the great Kings - Zeus, Poseidon and Hades and with each passing year the power of the Olympians diminished. With Hades no longer the King of the Underworld - the souls had no obligation to recompense for the crimes they had committed during their lives - they merely passed on - turning into dust and vanishing" Confused, the man shook his head "If the souls become dust upon death - why am I still here?" "Your questions shall be answered in time. For now, let me show you" The voice trailed off like a shadow trailing in the dust. "Show me what?" The man's voice was hoarse - his breathing ragged and hot against his hand. The voice didn't respond.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal">Time passed. Seconds? Minutes? Hours? By now the man felt an inner desire to let go - to let go and plummet into the hands of whatever fate had stored for him. His entire body throbbed - his arms ached and his heart had not ceased to pound fiercely against his chest. It was then that from within the grayish-blue chaos a lightning bolt crashed into the edge of cliff - exceedingly close to where the man clung onto with his slowly diminishing strength. Electric blue sparks sprung from the impact and landed on his hand causing him to howl out in pain and agony. His hand slipped - the pain being too much to bear and before he knew it he was falling into the bottomless void that lay below him.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">To be continued ...&nbsp;</div></div>

          <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div class="MsoNormal">University has started again. I’m not sure if I should be excited or not – this being my last year and all. I guess I should be because once university is over, I can go back to doing what I love best: sleeping. Ah, how much I love that deep slumber where your mind is oblivious of all the worries in the world. It really is the best feeling ever. That is, until your mind is plagued with dark desolate dreams that seem insistent on staying. My “nightmares”, unlike some, do not consist of monsters and dragons (those are actually quite cool) but rather entail situations which deep down, I fear.&nbsp; Upon waking, I’m more likely to remember the feelings I felt while having the dream rather than the details –such as the people that were present and my surroundings. That means it’s very difficult for me to describe the dream later on – as describing feelings, especially for me, is not an easy task. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">On the other hand, graduation means I’ve got other things to worry about. Such as:&nbsp;whether to continue with my Masters right after or to work. Although I love learning and in the past would not have hesitated with such a decision, I’ve come to realize that attending lectures and reading textbooks really isn’t for me.&nbsp; Being a goody two shoes all my life, I’ve never actually skipped a single class (alright, maybe I’m exaggerating just a bit). But during this past summer, I've come to realize I learn best when I’m experimenting, thinking, and applying – all of which, I believe, passive environments fail to provide. I learn more by “doing”, and fail to see the point of theoretical concepts unless they’re presented in a practical fashion. Even with alternative methods of learning such as projects that allow you to learn through experimentation, some universities insist on using the traditional approach of lecture based learning (or maybe that’s just my university). That is why I’m having doubts of continuing my studies when I could be out in the field, putting to practice all the theoretical knowledge that is currently in my head. &nbsp;<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div></div>
