  <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><b style="background-color: white;"><br /></b><br /><div class="MsoNormal"><i><b style="background-color: white;"><br /></b></i></div><div class="MsoNormal"><i><b style="background-color: white;">Blood bumped throughout my entire body. My head rested between my knees as my shoulders heaved up and down to the beat of my heart. I was sitting against the wall on the platform overlooking our Olympic sized swimming pool - trying to catch my breath after a ten minute workout of intense running. When my breathing finally slowed down, I pushed my head back to look out towards the ripples gently forming on the water surface. From where I sat, the water looked so deliciously cold as if tempting me to take a giant leap from the banister and into its welcoming embrace. The mental image of my head hitting the bottom if I miscalculated the distance flashed through my head. Now that would be suicide, I gently chided to myself pushing the thought away. I sighed - and&nbsp; after a moment or two my mind&nbsp;</b></i><b><i>unintentionall</i></b><i><b style="background-color: white;">y drifted to the heartrending events of two days ago</b></i></div><div class="MsoNormal"><i><b style="background-color: white;"><br /></b></i></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b style="background-color: white;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I came home that day to find my mother stressed out beyond her capacity&nbsp; to the point where she threatened to - oh, I would rather not mention what she threatened - and me, being the stubborn idiot I am, refused to back down and accept my dad's decision of not letting me stay back for Toastmasters that day.&nbsp;</b><br /><b style="background-color: white;"><br /></b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b style="background-color: white;">"But I've always stayed back! He's never had a problem with it before!" - "Why am I being treated like a child all of a sudden?" - "This isn't bloody fair. Nobody else has to be chaperoned!" I trudged moodily around the house - feeling as though I'd been betrayed - not once realizing or it even occurring to me what my mother must be feeling because of all this. I always have been a bit stubborn when it comes to doing what I want. It's not something I'm proud of but rather ashamed especially when it concerns my parents. A vivid memory is of me as a four year old: standing against the cold pane of our empty house staring stubbornly out at my parents and older sister pulling out from the driveway and not saying a single word.&nbsp; </b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b style="background-color: white;"><br /></b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b style="background-color: white;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Things didn't get any better with me sulking about this new turn of events: my mother (may God bless her and grant her Janat Al Firdous) having been working the entire day and who was bone tired was in no mood to see me the way I was. It took just a single complaint to make her break down right in front of me - and that is when it hit me in the chest. Hard. My stubbornness and refusal to accept my father's decision had clouded my sight - my mother was distressed and it was MY fault. All because I was too selfish to accept a single decision which was probably for my own good anyway. I decided to do the unselfish thing - called up my professor - and told her I wasn't going to be able to make it that day (because if I did - my mother would have to come with me - and that would be asking too much from her) Even before I put down the phone, I could feel the prickle in my eyes and hear the crack in my own &nbsp;voice - and once the line went dead - the tears came gushing out.</b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b style="background-color: white;"><br /></b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b style="background-color: white;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I cried for at least an hour. The tears just wouldn't stop coming no matter how hard I tried to stop them. I cried for my mother and all the pain I'd caused her. I cried for being such a failure as a daughter. I cried knowing I'd never be able to make it up to her - &nbsp;everything she's ever done for me. I cried because I try, I try so hard and yet it still is not enough. And yes I cried because I would not be attending toastmasters - and it kind of hurt knowing deep down that it probably wouldn't make a difference whether I was there or not. </b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b style="background-color: white;"><br /></b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b style="background-color: white;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I stood up for Asr prayer and even then the tears kept trickling down my cheeks. When I mouthed the words "You alone we worship, and You alone we ask for help" - the tears intensified until my vision blurred and I could no longer see the floor in front of me.&nbsp;It felt like all my bottled up emotions - my disappointments, my anger, my sadness, my hurt were all being poured out in the form of water - like a tap left running. When I finally finished my prayer, I felt a lot calmer and my tears eventually subsided as if someone had reached out and gently closed the tap. </b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b style="background-color: white;"><br /></b></div><div align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><i><b style="background-color: white;">And my heart didn't hurt anymore.<o:p></o:p></b></i></div><div align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><i><b style="background-color: white;"><br /></b></i></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b style="background-color: white;">&nbsp; &nbsp; Looking back at it I think of myself as being rather silly - crying so much - when I've always prided myself at being strong. "Crying is a sign of weakness" or at least that's what I've always told myself. But I've come to realize that crying is how we <i>know</i> we care for someone - and to care for someone is probably the greatest strength a person can have. </b><br /><b style="background-color: white;"><br /></b></div><div align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><b style="background-color: white;">Afterwards, my father sat me down and talked things</b></div><div align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><b style="background-color: white;">&nbsp;through with me - we reached an understanding - at least for the time being. </b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div></div>

No matter where I searched - in my very messy closet, on my cluttered dressing table or even underneath the covers of my bed - I just couldn't find it. "How could a book that noticeable just ... disappear?" - "I must have dropped it on my way out of the car" "Or perhaps I left it at my grandparents place?" These were the thoughts that kept swirling through my head the entire time. A constant reminder that I was missing something and that if I didn't find it&nbsp; as soon as possible, I was a goner. A number was dialed and my grandmother picked up on the other end. "No, dear, your book isn't here". I sighed as I placed the receiver back down. Every time I would rack my memory for the exact place where I had left the book when I had come home - I would be greeted with a black empty space and a headache. </b></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><b style="background-color: white;"><br /></b></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><b style="background-color: white;">The book seemed to have vanished.&nbsp; Or at least that's the story I went with seeing as there was no other explanation. </b></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><b style="background-color: white;"><br /></b></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><b style="background-color: white;">&nbsp;***</b></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><b style="background-color: white;"><br /></b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b style="background-color: white;">The next day I walked towards my professor's office: twiddling my fingers as I knocked on her door and was welcomed in with a huge smile and a gesture to have a seat. My professor who can see right through me, knew this wasn't a spontaneous visit which is usually the case. I promptly related to her the entire situation, starting with the visit to my grandparent's place and ending with the disappearance of my German book. </b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b style="background-color: white;"><br /></b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: red;"><i><b style="background-color: white;">"It's gone.

          <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><i><b style="background-color: white;">M</b><b><span style="background-color: white;">y fourth toastmaster's speech given on&nbsp;February, 03, 2013*. The objective of the speech was "How you say it". I really hope you enjoy it! =)&nbsp;</span></b></i><br /><b style="background-color: white;"><br /></b><br /><div class="MsoNormal"><b style="background-color: white;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Have any of you ever thought of delving into the wonders of the Quran? For those of who do not know what the Quran is, it is the Holy book of Muslims- a proclaimed miracle that was sent down to mankind from God in times of need -&nbsp; like a beacon in a stormy night. </b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b style="background-color: white;"><br /></b></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><b style="background-color: white;">Fellow Toastmasters, honorable guests, good evening. </b></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><b style="background-color: white;"><br /></b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b style="background-color: white;">&nbsp; I feel&nbsp; that learning the Quran is like diving in to the ocean; the deeper you go, the more intrigued you become. Just like any other form of literature, the Quran has its own unique literary gems hidden deep inside of it. But to actually extract the wonders of the Quran yourself requires a great deal of knowledge and dedication because of the richness of the Arabic language. Which is why today I am going to show you just a few of the marvels concealed in the words of the Quran that you would otherwise not see if you just skimmed over the surface.&nbsp;</b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b style="background-color: white;"><br /></b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b style="background-color: white;">In Surah Al Mu'minoon, God says: <span dir="RTL" lang="AR-SA" style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ascii-font-family: Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-hansi-font-family: Calibri; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin;">قَدْ أَفْلَحَ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ</span><span dir="LTR"></span><span dir="LTR"></span>, &nbsp;Successful indeed are the believers. Aflaha means success and is used in the Arabic language to indicate the highest level of success. Interestingly, the word Aflaha or Falah is also used by Arabs to refer to the farmer or specifically the farmer during the crop season. The work a farmer does is all year long – he tends to his crops in the scorching summer heat – replants them in case of winds or any form of calamity – and at the end of the year, he harvests them. The entire time, the farmer is exerting a great amount of effort but h<a href="http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=4462657713128621236" name="_GoBack"></a>e does not see the fruits of his labor until the very end. Which is exactly like the believer. The believer is constantly striving for God's sake in order to gain that final unseen reward, Paradise. </b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b style="background-color: white;"><br /></b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b style="background-color: white;">&nbsp; &nbsp;In another Surah, Surah Al Ahzab, God says: <span dir="RTL" lang="AR-SA" style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ascii-font-family: Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-hansi-font-family: Calibri; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin;">مَّا جَعَلَ اللَّـهُ لِرَجُلٍ مِّن قَلْبَيْنِ فِي جَوْفِهِ</span><span dir="LTR"></span><span lang="AR-SA"><span dir="LTR"></span> </span>Allah has not put for any man two hearts inside his body.&nbsp;What's important to notice is that the word Rajul is used which singles out men in particular. Also, to refer to the place where the hearts are kept, the word body (jowf) is used instead of chest Sadar even though throughout the entire Quran God talks about "the hearts in the chests". Why has this been done? </b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b style="background-color: white;"><br /></b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b style="background-color: white;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Well, you see when a woman is carrying she contains two hearts inside her body, her own and the baby's. In both &nbsp;these examples precise words were used in order to convey a specific message. </b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b style="background-color: white;"><br /></b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b style="background-color: white;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Another gem can be found in Surah Al Ikhlas, where God says: <span class="apple-converted-space"><span style="font-family: KFGQPC_Naskh, serif; font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%;">&nbsp;</span></span><span dir="RTL" lang="AR-SA" style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ascii-font-family: Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-hansi-font-family: Calibri; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin;">اللَّـهُ الصَّمَدُ</span><span dir="LTR"></span><span dir="LTR"></span>The Self-Sufficient Master. But the word Al Samad actually has a couple of meanings: As a verb it means to turn attention towards someone or to demand from them a fulfillment or need. The word Masmood is actually what Al Samad implies and it is someone who people turn to in time of need. </b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b style="background-color: white;"><br /></b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b style="background-color: white;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Another verbal meaning is when you make someone your goal, when you aspire to reach them, when you aspire to please them or when you aspire to attain them. When you make someone the goal in your life that is Al Samad. </b><br /><b style="background-color: white;"><br /></b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b style="background-color: white;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Al Samad can also refer to someone who is not in need of anyone else and no one can overpower them in terms status or in any attribute. In Arabic literature it's used for a person who cannot be overcome, meaning he can't be overcome in battle, you can't out do them in business, or in their leadership or in their studies or anything for that matter. That person would be Al Samad. </b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b style="background-color: white;"><br /></b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b style="background-color: white;">&nbsp; Al Samad can also be an adjective and it is used to describe something that is whole, without any blemishes or faults. For example, a pure brick of Gold would be Al Samad, or a boulder without any holes to let water or air inside would be Al Samad. Something absolute, something concrete.</b><br /><b style="background-color: white;"><br /></b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b style="background-color: white;">&nbsp; So now the question arises, which of the meanings applies to this verse? The answer is all of them. That's one of the gems of the Quran, a single word used can have multiple meanings all of which apply to the same verse.&nbsp;</b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b style="background-color: white;"><br /></b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b style="background-color: white;">And finally in Surah Al Mudathir God says: <span class="apple-converted-space"><span style="font-family: KFGQPC_Naskh, serif; font-size: 16.5pt; line-height: 115%;">&nbsp;</span></span><span dir="RTL" lang="AR-SA" style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ascii-font-family: Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-hansi-font-family: Calibri; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin;">وَرَبَّكَ فَكَبِّرْ</span><span dir="LTR"></span><span dir="LTR"></span>. Declare the greatness only of your master . The <span dir="RTL" lang="AR-SA" style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ascii-font-family: Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-hansi-font-family: Calibri; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin;">و</span><span dir="LTR"></span><span dir="LTR"></span> here actually has many different meanings in Classical Arabic. One of the meanings is to signify the beginning of a sentence just like you have the capital letter in English. If you look at this verse with that in mind you can see that it is actually a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or a phrase that is spelt the same backwards and forwards which as you can see is the case here. </b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b style="background-color: white;"><br /></b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b style="background-color: white;">These four were just a few of the many gems buried deep within the very essence of the Quran. Just like the ocean floor, the Quran has a number of gems waiting to be discovered. &nbsp;The fact is we don't realize the beauty and power concealed behind the words of the Quran because it is one book we take for granted.</b><br /><b style="background-color: white;"><br /></b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b style="background-color: white;">In Surah al Ra'ad Allah says:</b><br /><b style="background-color: white;">And if there was any Qur'an by which the mountains would be removed or the earth would be broken apart or the dead would be made to speak, [it would be this Qur'an]. &nbsp;&nbsp;</b><br /><b style="background-color: white;"><br /></b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b style="background-color: white;">There is so much more to this book that we are missing and so much that we could gain just by becoming it's Students of Knowledge. All it takes is an enthusiastic spirit with the determination to undertake a fascinating journey into the very depths of it's pages. As William Blake once said: In the universe, there are things that are known and things that are unknown and in between there are the doors.</b><br /><b style="background-color: white;"><br /></b><b style="background-color: white;"><br /></b><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><i style="background-color: white;"><b>This speech was&nbsp;inspired&nbsp;by the information that was gained by listening to Ustadh Nouman Ali Khan.
