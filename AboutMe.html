      <h1>Yumna</h1>
      <p class="tagline">Writer â€¢ Developer â€¢ Dreamer of a gentler world</p>

      <p>Hey, Iâ€™m <strong>Yumna</strong> - a writer, dreamer, and mama of two, trying to find meaning in the mundane. My days are filled with little hands, quiet prayers, and a heart thatâ€™s always learning.</p>
      
      <p>I love exploring how remembrance can live beyond words â€” how <em>adhkar </em>, reflection, and sincerity can take form in stories, worlds, and even games. One of my favorite projects is a zombie-themed <a href="https://duas-for-zombie-apocolypse.netlify.app">website </a> where reciting morning and evening adhkar becomes your shield â€” a small reminder that faith protects, no matter how dark the world feels.
      </p>
      
      <p>I also created a small game called <a href="https://doubleoseven.github.io/BunnyTrouble.html" target="_blank"><strong>Bunny Trouble</strong></a> â€” a project that taught me a lot about patience, problem-solving, and the joy of bringing an idea to life. It reminded me that creativity doesnâ€™t have to be grand to be meaningful; sometimes, itâ€™s the smallest things that make us smile and grow.</p>
      
      <p>Through my <a href="https://themuslimahtigress.blogspot.com">writings </a> and  <a href="https://github.com/doubleoseven">projects </a>, I hope to remind hearts (including my own) that Allah is always near â€” in the calm, the chaos, and everything in between.</p>
