      <h1>Yumna</h1>
      <p class="tagline">Writer â€¢ Developer â€¢ Dreamer of a gentler world</p>

      <p>Hey, Iâ€™m <strong>Yumna</strong> â€” a writer, dreamer, and mama of two, trying to find meaning in the mundane. My days are filled with little hands, quiet prayers, and a heart thatâ€™s always learning.</p>
      
      <p>Faith is at the center of everything I do. I believe remembrance (<em>dhikr</em>) doesnâ€™t only belong in quiet worship; it can live in stories, art, and even games. One of my favorite work in progress projects is a zombie-themed game where morning and evening <em>adhkar</em> become shields â€” a reminder that faith protects us, even in the most unexpected worlds.</p>
      
      <p>I also created a small game called <a href="https://doubleoseven.github.io/BunnyTrouble.html" target="_blank"><strong>Bunny Trouble</strong></a> â€” a simple project that taught me a lot about patience, problem-solving, and the joy of bringing an idea to life. It reminded me that creativity doesnâ€™t have to be grand to be meaningful; sometimes, itâ€™s the smallest things that make us smile and grow.</p>
      
      <p>Through my writing and projects, I hope to remind hearts (including my own) that Allah is always near â€” in the calm, the chaos, and everything in between.</p>
