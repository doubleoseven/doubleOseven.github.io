For the previous two projects, I tried to get my hands a little dirty with Javascript. Although, I'm familiar with JS, I wanted to review some of the syntax and what better way to do that than write some code. 
<br> <br>
So the first project is extremely simple, it's almost embarressing. (However, something is always better than nothing). Using html, I added two buttons to the page: the first displays today's date, in the following format: 
<br><br>
Day of Week, Month Day Year. 
<br> <br>
In order to acheive this, all I did was use two arrays to store the number of days and months as strings.

{% highlight javascript %}

	var days = [];
	var months = [];

{% endhighlight %}

 I then used the 'new Date()' function to get a reference to the date variable and stored it in a variable called day. 


{% highlight javascript %}

	var day = new Date();

{% endhighlight %}


 I then used 'day' to call on the functions getDay(),  getMonth(), getDate() and getFullYear() in order to get the information I needed. All the functions return integers, so I passed the result of getDay() and getMonth() into the arrays I created to display their string counterparts. 

 {% highlight javascript %}

	today.innerHTML = "Today is " + days[day.getDay()] + ", " +
			months[day.getMonth()] + " " + day.getDate() + " " + day.getFullYear();

{% endhighlight %}And that's pretty much it!
