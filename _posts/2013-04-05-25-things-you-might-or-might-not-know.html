<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><br /><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp; I was looking through my facebook notes the other day and I came across the "25 Random Things About Me" which I'd written back in 2009. So I thought to myself, why not&nbsp;rewrite&nbsp;it now that it's 2013 and I'm a couple of years older? It took some time but I finally got around to writing it and so here it is! =)</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">1) I am literally obsessed with Germany - it's my dream to visit it. Also: I think the German language is absolutely lovely and I would love to speak it fluently some day. (I do know some, but the grammar still goes over my head) </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">2) I'm usually mistaken for being quiet when you first meet me but once I've gotten comfortable and known you long enough, be prepared for a permanent headache. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">3) My interests change periodically. At the moment it's anything related to religion, science(D.A.)*, world affairs(D.A.)*, and Naruto. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">4) I procrastinate big time by watching religious debates. (D.A.)*</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">5) Yes, I'm an anime lover but I'm extremely picky about my animes. They have to have depth, character development, and be CLEAN. :p (Epic fights wouldn't hurt either) </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">6) A few years ago I'd say I'm an extremely unemotional person: Now I'm not so sure - The tears come way too easily. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">7) My close friends mean the world to me - perhaps because I have so few of them and I'd prefer to keep it that way. Also, I would do anything for them just to make them happy. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">8) My older sister is my best friend - she's probably the only one who knows me through and through. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">9) I'm an open book at times - my feelings seem to be written all over my face no matter how hard I attempt to hide them. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">10) You do NOT want to try and frighten me in the dark (or even at night) - you'll end up with a hysterical girl who will probably die of a heart attack. I repeat: it is not recommended. (Unless you WANT me to die - but that would just be mean :p) </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">11) I actually like debating. Seriously, it's fun.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">12) I'm a fan of salad, running on a daily basis, and chocolate. My day isn't complete without those three. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">13) If I wasn't doing computer science, I'd probably dedicate my life to doing Tafseer and Arabic studies - I find it quite fascinating. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">14) I can be awkward at times. Extremely awkward. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">15) I have this obsession with adorable, furry things which is just&nbsp;unexplainable&nbsp;especially for a nineteen year old. Also: gift me a baby kitten, and I'll love you forever. :p</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">16) My bucket list includes being a professional race car driver, going deep sea diving, and playing the guitar. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">17) I used to wish I was born a boy when I was younger, but now I'm perfectly happy being a girl :p I still do want an older brother though. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">18) I want my husband to be my best friend - one who loves me, understands me, is patient with me despite all my faults, one who I can tease all I want and be teased back - And above all, someone who will help me become a better Muslimah so we can attain paradise together. (I still have my dream of him being a convert)&nbsp;</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">19) The last good book I read was Honour and The Sword - that was one epic historical fiction which I certainly recommend.&nbsp;</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">20) My goal in life is to become a better person and Muslim so that I am able to serve my Deen (religion) in the best possible way. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">21) I can be extremely criticizing at times - although I try my best to reduce sounding harsh. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">22) I have two amazing cousins who I hold dearly in my heart. I'd consider them my sisters in a heartbeat anyday.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">23) Yes, I can be sweet when I want to - get on my wrong side though and I'll make you regret it. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">24) I'm a nervous wreck before giving a speech - afterwards though I feel like I've conquered the entire world. :p </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">25) Writing this has made me realize I've changed a lot more than I thought from a few years ago. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">*D.A. = Don't Ask.&nbsp;</div></div>
