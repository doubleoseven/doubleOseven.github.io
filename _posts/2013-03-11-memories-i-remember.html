Perhaps it's because that's where I grew up - I pretty much spent the first seven years of my life there. It's surprising how even though I wasn't very old, the memories I have of the place are so vividly clear it's as if they occurred yesterday. I actually haven't been there for the past thirteen years ever since we moved here to Saudi Arabia, so I'm hoping inshaAllah that I do get to visit sometime in the future - perhaps even this year (Now, that would be exciting). Probably why it's been on my mind lately. &nbsp;(The summer isn't too far away :p)&nbsp;What really saddens me though is that even if I did, nothing would be the same as it once was - neither the place nor the people&nbsp;and that makes my heart ache. </i></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div></div>
