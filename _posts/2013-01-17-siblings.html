<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><span style="background-color: white;"><br /></span><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: white;">&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>So here I've watched The Hobbit for the second time in a row. Other than the fact it's a spectacular movie which I could watch a hundred times (just like I did with all three parts of LOTR - man, I really can't get how ANYONE could call them boring) and still not get tired of it - the rest of my siblings hadn't seen it yet. But when my younger brother walked in while I sat at my laptop watching a tutorial on HTML coding and announced that everyone was waiting for me to come join them, I have to admit, I was initially kind of annoyed. I really don't like being disturbed especially when I'm in that mood for learning (which isn't very often - usually I'd prefer to just curl up and go to sleep). Before I could tell him to leave me alone and go away, I&nbsp; stopped for a second and reconsidered the relationship we have as siblings. Alhamdulilah, I could say I am very blessed indeed to be very close to my siblings - we share a bond that is thicker than blood - an unbreakable bond. Don't get me wrong, we most certainly have our ups and downs (you really don't want to see us get into a fight - I'm warning you, it's not pretty) but there is that understanding, that connection we share knowing we'd be there for each other when no one else is. </b></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b style="background-color: white;"><br /></b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b style="background-color: white;">&nbsp; &nbsp;I'm sure a lot of people have the same relationship with their siblings (I could be wrong though) - but I've realized that this connection isn't something that was just there - it was developed through little things such as watching a movie together, or sharing popcorn, or even discussing a favorite book. As trivial as these things may seem, it's what brings people closer. And it's certainly what brings us together. These opportunities that we are given to spend time with one other should not be wasted away, or considered unimportant but rather they should be held close to our heart and treasured for all times. </b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b style="background-color: white;"><br /></b></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><b style="background-color: white;">&nbsp; &nbsp;We may not share the same personalities, or have the same outlook on things but what we do share is enough for us to put aside our differences and accept each other for who we are: a family.</b></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><br /></div></div>
