<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Helvetica;">In my family, I’m the girl who’s broken more laptops then anyone else, not because I can’t take care of them, but because I’m always experimenting with them in some way or another. My first laptop used to crashing constantly due to a problem in it’s hard disk (which I believe was kind of my fault) and I remember formatting it each time it refused to turn on, which was quite often. Eventually getting tired of losing data, I learned how to partition my hard disk (because I really didn’t have access to an external hard disk). I was only fourteen at the time.&nbsp;</div><div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 13px;"><br /></div><div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Helvetica;">By the time I was in high school, I had a pretty good idea on how to install an operating system from scratch. Everyone in the house considered me the “technician”, requesting me to overlook their computer whenever things got too slow. I also had a knack for solving computer problems by scrolling through forums whenever I was faced with the “blue screen of death” and trying out different solutions. My motto was, and still is: there’s always an answer.&nbsp;</div><div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 13px;"><br /></div><div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Helvetica;">Even then, being more interested in playing video games, I never really delved deep enough into the inner workings of the computer, and thus, I never tried my hands at programming (something I deeply regret). This was partly because we never took programming in high school, and I never thought of looking into it myself. That is, until I decided I wanted to major in Computer Science. My decision was greatly influenced by my love for video games. “I want to become a video game developer and influence people with my ideas” -&nbsp; Said my naive younger self. After researching about the field, I decided computer science would be the best way to go. Little did I know about the journey I was about to embark on.&nbsp;</div><div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 13px;"><br /></div><div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Helvetica; text-align: center;"><i><b>“The more I learn about the internet, the more magical it seems.”</b></i></div><div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 13px; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Helvetica;">Most of the courses I’m taking this semester are in someway connected to the Internet: Computer Networks, Web Design and Information Security. And honestly, I have to say, I’m pretty much captivated by what the internet is. Just imagining tiny packets consisting only of 0s and 1s travelling over hundreds of miles only to reach their destination in the form of text, pictures, or video is enough to make my mind whirl. And actually knowing what’s going on behind the scenes, makes waiting for an excruciatingly slow page to load so much more interesting.&nbsp;</div><div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Helvetica;"><br /></div><div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Helvetica;">#RandomThoughts&nbsp;</div><div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px; min-height: 13px;"><br /></div><br /><div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px; min-height: 13px;"><br /></div></div>
