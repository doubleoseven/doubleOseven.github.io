<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><span style="background-color: white;"><br /></span><span style="background-color: white;"><b><br /></b></span><br /><div class="MsoNormal"><b style="background-color: white;">Well, let's just say I'm very original and so copying my tumblr blog name and using it for this one just seemed quite appropriate. XD</b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b style="background-color: white;"><br /></b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b style="background-color: white;">Actually, I've always loved big furry cats - my dream as a kid (and it still is my dream) is to keep a baby cheetah as a pet, raise it and then ride it&nbsp;cheetah-back&nbsp;across the fields of Africa (and probably get arrested for animal abuse in the process :p) </b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b style="background-color: white;"><br /></b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b style="background-color: white;">But then why a tiger in particular, you may ask? I guess it's because I've always identified with Tigger from Winnie The Pooh who happens to be a tiger. Also: as a kid if I were to compare myself to any animal it would be a tiger because I'd be very easy to anger and you would certainly not want to be at the receiving end of my anger, hence "The Tiger Roars". </b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b style="background-color: white;"><br /></b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b style="background-color: white;">That being said: the Tiger Roars sounded rather epic to my ears and so I decided to reuse it instead of having to come up with another epic sounding blog name.
