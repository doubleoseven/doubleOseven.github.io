<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div class="MsoNormal">Seeing as I once did an “<a href="http://themuslimahtigress.blogspot.com/2013/03/memories-i-remember.html" target="_blank">I remember</a>” post centering around our time in America, I thought I’d do one for our time here in Jeddah. I've lived here for the past thirteen years and to be perfectly honest with you, I've got some great memories of the place. Regardless of what you may have heard or read, Jeddah like any other place has its ups and downs and considering the fact that I was born here and half of my mother’s family lives here I've grown to love the place as my own. (No, I’m not Saudi, in case you’re wondering). <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;">So here goes my list of memories: I hope you enjoy them!<o:p></o:p></div><div align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">I remember playing with the two stay kittens that lived in the bushes outside my grandparent’s house. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">I remember letting them climb all over my legs - they’re tiny claws scratching my skin. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">I remember the countless sleepovers at my grandparent’s house – (their new and former one) – the late night talks with my cousin, the stories she would demand I tell her (I did enjoy telling them, I promise!), and the secrets we would exchange in the dead of the night.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">I remember watching my uncle (who was just a teen back then) play Metal Gear and countless other video games such as Need For Speed, Fear, GTA, and one featuring a Japanese character – he never did tell us what that one was called despite all the begging we did. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">I remember the cold air that always escaped through the space beneath the door of my uncle’s room – I remember taking turns with my sister, putting our feet as close as we could, savoring the freezing cold air. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">I remember the countless fights I had with my cousin: most revolving around me wanting to sit down with a book and her wanting me to play tag, or hide-and-seek or whatever it was we used to play in those days. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">I remember the bird we nursed back to health that had been injured in a fall, and later watching it fly away in to the sky – strong and healthy again. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">I remember playing games that consisted of filling our room up with foam balls – pushing the mattress off the bed to make ourselves a ship – and setting the air conditioner to absurd temperatures so we could pretend we’d reached Antarctica. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">I remember my days in primary and middle school – how I was always considered the “quiet”, “shy” kid and how much I inwardly <i>hated</i>that. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">I remember lying to my sixth grade teacher about showing my report card to my mother because I was too afraid to tell her the truth – she saw right through me on the spot.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">I remember being such a clean freak, where every speck of dust would annoy the hell out of me.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">I remember dropping a huge bowl golabjamen<sup>(1)</sup>right in front of some late night guests - the syrup ended up running down my pants and onto the floor while I just stood there dumbstruck.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">I remember my mother becoming furious, and my father gently telling me it was alright. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">I remember the long bus rides back from school, hanging out with the older girls in the back – and falling asleep by the time we reached our stop.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">I remember the messed up jokes my friends would make in high school – the headaches we gave our teachers - especially the social worker, and the good times we all shared.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">I remember hanging out in the deputy headmistress’s office while collaborating on the school magazine my friend Miriam and I were in charge of. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">I remember dressing up as a guy once while our grandmother (Allah Yarhamha<sup>(2)</sup>) was staying with us – her reaction was to pretend I was some stranger from the streets and to keep telling me to get out – I just stood there, doubling up in laughter. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">I remember when our aunt and her sons would visit from the states, the family get-togethers we’d have, mostly consisting of all of us cousins crowding around our uncles and annoying the hell out of them. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">I remember riding my uncle’s quad bike over the sand dunes in the outskirts of Jeddah. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">I remember attempting a dive into the Red Sea on one of our recent trips there, and ending up with a nose full of water instead.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">I remember performing my first Hajj when I was sixteen –&nbsp; camping out in Mina while rain fell from the skies,&nbsp; asking for forgiveness in Arafat and sleeping under the night sky in Muzdalifah.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">I remember getting my first (unofficial) marriage proposal on Hajj from some random Egyptian lady who thought I’d be good for her son – now THAT was awkward.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">I remember riding my younger cousin’s bike (which I "borrowed" on the spot from him) down the street next to the highway because I was too tired to run and catch up with my sister and uncle who were way&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; line-height: 115%;">ahead.&nbsp;</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><sup><o:p></o:p></sup></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">I remember the late nights where all of us siblings would make corny jokes, tease each other to no end and laugh till our sides hurt and our throats were all raw.<span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; line-height: 115%;">&nbsp;</span><sup style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; line-height: 115%;">(3)</sup></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><i>I remember, I remember, I remember</i></div><div align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><i><br /></i></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;">My. Thirteen years is a long time. I could probably go on and on, but I think I’ll stop here,<strike> because I think you get the point: Jeddah is awesome - and if you haven't been here, well, let me just say - you are missing out mate. :p (Okay - that was totally not needed. Sigh. I suck at humor)</strike><o:p></o:p><br />*Scratches that all out* The real point is: no matter where you are, be thankful for the people and moments in your life (even if things don't always go the way you want them to) - because you never know when all that will be taken away. Sometimes, we need to look past all the "bad" times to realize how blessed we actually are - and I'd say <i>I'm</i> extremely blessed. Alhamdulilah (Praise to God).<br /><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><i><br /></i></div><div class="MsoNormal"><o:p>(1) An Indian/Pakistani&nbsp;dessert&nbsp;which you MUST try.&nbsp;</o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><o:p>(2) An Arabic phrase which means: May God have mercy on her soul.</o:p><br />(3) We still do that. =)&nbsp;</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div></div>
