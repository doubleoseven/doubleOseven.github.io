<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div class="MsoNormal"><i>A short story I've been writing for a while, just for fun. Haven't finished it yet but I thought if I posted it on my blog, I might be motivated to do so. Hope you enjoy it and comments are more than welcome. :)</i><br /><hr /><br /><br />Lightning crashed - hitting the earth above him and he trembled from the very thought of accidentally letting go. The world around him was a mixture of electric blue and gray swirling collectively in the pouring heavy rain as he hung off the edge of the cliff desperately clinging for his life. His clothes were drenched; rainwater running in rivulets from his dark hair and through the creases in his shirt. He grit his teeth as he pushed his hands against the moist soil - using all his strength in his attempt to pull himself up. Beads of sweat mixed with water trickled down his forehead; his breath came out in short spasms and fear shone clearly though his bluish-green eyes. Above him the sound of the rain as it pounded the earth could be heard echoing through the darkness wrapped around him. He was terrified; and yet all the strength in the world could not assist in saving him from what was his doom. His fragile heart beat hard against his chest and he felt as if he were drowning in this sheet of rain that seemed to envelop him in a deathly embrace. There was a clap of thunder and a lightning bolt lit up the yawning night sky and suddenly he felt a searing pain escalate throughout his entire body. He gasped in response unable to withstand the pain that made him feel as if his very veins were on fire. His unoccupied hand reached up to rub his temples as a quiet moan escaped his lips "Why? Why me? What have <i>I d</i>one to deserve this?".</div><div class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">The sound of the rain subsided and it was then that a deep low voice responded to him from within the darkness shaking the very platform on which he clutched onto with his dear life. "Shall I show you?" The man, taken by surprise frantically turned his head towards the direction of the voice trying to pinpoint its location. "Who are you?"He shouted uneasily into the void. "I am the guardian of this wretched place" "Guardian?" "Yes. Long ago the souls of the dead would be brought here to be punished by the command of Master Hades. Over the years, the humans stopped worshiping the great Kings - Zeus, Poseidon and Hades and with each passing year the power of the Olympians diminished. With Hades no longer the King of the Underworld - the souls had no obligation to recompense for the crimes they had committed during their lives - they merely passed on - turning into dust and vanishing" Confused, the man shook his head "If the souls become dust upon death - why am I still here?" "Your questions shall be answered in time. For now, let me show you" The voice trailed off like a shadow trailing in the dust. "Show me what?" The man's voice was hoarse - his breathing ragged and hot against his hand. The voice didn't respond.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal">Time passed. Seconds? Minutes? Hours? By now the man felt an inner desire to let go - to let go and plummet into the hands of whatever fate had stored for him. His entire body throbbed - his arms ached and his heart had not ceased to pound fiercely against his chest. It was then that from within the grayish-blue chaos a lightning bolt crashed into the edge of cliff - exceedingly close to where the man clung onto with his slowly diminishing strength. Electric blue sparks sprung from the impact and landed on his hand causing him to howl out in pain and agony. His hand slipped - the pain being too much to bear and before he knew it he was falling into the bottomless void that lay below him.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">To be continued ...&nbsp;</div></div>
