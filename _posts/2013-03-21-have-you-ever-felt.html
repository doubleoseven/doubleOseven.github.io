<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><i>Have you ever felt as if you were isolated from the world and the people in it?</i></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><i><br /></i></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><i>As if there was a barrier of glass between you and them. </i></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><i><br /></i></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><i>You hear their voices and their laughter echoing around you - so close and yet so very distant. </i></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><i><br /></i></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><i>You feel as if you're not really part of them. As if you don't actually belong. And that whether or not you were there - it wouldn't make a difference.</i></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><i><br /></i></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><i>&nbsp;You feel as if no matter how hard you try to just be yourself - it simply isn't enough. That you'll always be a mere shadow - forgotten and stepped on. </i></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><i><br /></i></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><i>And then you wonder to yourself, is it worth it? To be surrounded by people who couldn't care less about your very existence. </i></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;">And then you write corny lines to make yourself feel better and just end up sounding pathetic.</div><div align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Yumna, Yumna, Yumna, for God's sake - stop being so depressed. :/*</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Alright. <i>Alright</i>. But seriously though - I do feel like that sometimes no matter how hard I try not to. It's frustrating, tbh. And I know I shouldn't feel this way - especially when I have <i>so much</i> to be thankful for, &nbsp;but deep down, I just can't help it at times. And I'm not writing this for pity or anything like that - I'm simply &nbsp;letting out&nbsp;how I feel. (It was actually just an on the whim kind of thing) As to why I feel this way? I don't know. I'm a woman - we can't understand even ourselves. :p &nbsp;Writing out my feelings though has certainly made me feel better ...&nbsp; which is probably a good thing, right? ... <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Sigh. I need a break. A long one. Preferably by myself. Far, far, away. On the upside - I do have one week of vacation to look forward to - which is going to be filled with chocolate and sleep. &lt;3 (Assuming that isn't ruined by tons of guests and an invasion of my privacy) Now,<i> that</i> will&nbsp;certainly&nbsp;be lovely.<br /><br />Now I think I shall quit writing seeing as I probably sound like a depressed person who just needs a hug.&nbsp;</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">*Yes, I talk to myself. Don't mind me.&nbsp;</div></div>
