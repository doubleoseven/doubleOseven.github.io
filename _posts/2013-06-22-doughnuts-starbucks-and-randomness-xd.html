<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; My baby sister sat at the table with a piece of my brother’s chocolate croissant in front of her.&nbsp; Her voice echoed throughout Starbucks as she proclaimed in a feigned British accent: “Even if we do buy doughnuts afterwards, I wouldn't be able to eat them”.&nbsp; I shifted my gaze towards the scrumptious piece that lay in the plate in front of her: my hand lazily pointed towards it. “So … I can have that?” Startled, she cried out with a loud “No!” and instantly let out a stream of laughter. I rolled my eyes at her teasingly and continued to sip at the chocolate-chip ice blended drink that rested between my chilled fingers. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; Around us the place was nearly deserted except for a single table a few feet away where my other younger sister sat with her three friends. Despite the place being nearly abandoned, our table alone was probably enough to give the opposite impression. My older sister sat across from me sipping her coffee and making sarcastic remarks, while my brother attempted to imitate King Candy from Reck-it-Ralph at every opportune moment making us all crack up at. And yet, my baby sister was the one who stole the spotlight - from commenting on the ingredients that went into the cake she’d just devoured to friendly bickering with the three of us on how we should act more like ladies (excluding my brother of course) and yet acting like a complete barbarian herself. (Her words, not mine). <i>I </i>sat with a bemused look on my face – allowing myself to have a chuckle or two at how bloody hilarious we were and shifting from adopting a scowl to doubling over in laughter over something someone had said. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; This picture of today’s outing I have just painted is an unusual one especially with parents like ours (the overly protective kind) who have a habit of calling us up every five minutes to insure we’re still alive and haven’t tripped over our feet and fallen into a ditch – but it’s not as rare as you may think. (Or as rare as I may make it out to be) Although, what initially was supposed to be a visit to Krispy Kreme’s with a group of my younger sister’s friends, it turned out that fate had other plans. Prayer time being right around the corner, the employees at Krispy Kreme’s “kicked” us out the moment we walked in at 3:30 on the basis of it nearly being Salah (prayer) time and so they simply could not have customers. This resulted in the eight of us walking across the street (our drivers having all gone home) towards Starbucks and Krispy Kreme’s losing a couple of potential customers. (Well, not really. We did go back to buy from them anyway) <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; We ended up staying in Starbucks till almost five in the evening after which we walked back to Krispy Kreme’s and bought a box full of doughnuts for my parents. Later at home, we related the events to our mother who by now should be used to our random escapades – but was surprised nonetheless. I’m just glad we got back in one piece. (Mentally, that is) xP <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div></div>
