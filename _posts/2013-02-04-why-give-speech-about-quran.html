<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><br /><div align="center" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><i><b style="background-color: white;">Look at my previous post first before reading this. It's titled: "<a href="http://themuslimahtigress.blogspot.com/2013/02/gems-of-quran.html">Gems of the Quran</a>"</b></i></span></div><div align="center" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.5pt;"><b style="background-color: white;">&nbsp; A year ago, I probably wouldn't even have thought of giving a speech about the Quran. Tbh, my knowledge and interest in the Quran was limited to just reading and memorizing it (something my parents encouraged which eventually grew to a personal wish to finish&nbsp;memorizing&nbsp;the Quran (not that I was all that dedicated)). I rarely read the translation and the little knowledge (my knowledge is STILL very limited) I had was from compulsory Islam classes and my parents. I didn't just suddenly wake up one day and decide I was interested in knowing more about the Quran - I was too caught up in what I considered more important and interesting. What started it was something so unexpected it's almost crazy. It started with a conversation. A conversation with a non-Muslim about the Quran and for the first time I was in a position where I had to prove to someone that the Quran WAS the word of God. The more I talked to him, the more I realized I knew absolutely nothing about the book I claimed was a&nbsp;miracle from my Lord. I spent three days and nights - eating next to nothing - researching for hours trying to answer his questions. The more I researched - the more I was amazed at my findings. I came to realize what a&nbsp;beautiful&nbsp;book the Quran is, it's language, depth and wisdom is beyond what I have ever imagined. I came across amazing people such as Ustadh Nouman Ali Khan and Sheikh Abdul Nasir (may Allah bless them) who have dedicated their entire lives to teaching the Quran in a way that pulls you in: makes you want to listen. And it was the first time I was introduced to the Quran as a speech - as if Allah (God) &nbsp;was directly talking to me as I felt his words on my&nbsp;tongue. And that is when I realized what the Quran truly is - it is not book to be read once, put down and be forgotten - but rather a speech - one that begs to be heard, and felt by the heart. A speech that has the power to change people's entire lives.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></b></span></div><div style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><b style="background-color: white;"><br /></b></div><div align="center" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 13.5pt;"><b style="background-color: white;"><i>Who would have known that a non-Muslim would make me interested in my own religion?
