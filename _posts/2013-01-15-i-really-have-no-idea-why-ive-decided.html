<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><br /><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp; <b>&nbsp; I really have no idea why I've decided to start this blog. Tbh, I've never been the type to share my feelings but rather I've kept them bottled up most of the time. The fact is, I never could get myself to write my thoughts down. It was too much of a drag. But I feel seeing as I've got too much free time on my hands I might as well do something useful with it - and what better way than to have my own blog and share my thoughts with the world. Okay, this is sounding clich√©. But you get what I mean, right? </b></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><b><br /></b></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><b>&nbsp; &nbsp;Personally, I've always felt a blog is a way of reaching out to people and bridging the gap so that we can better understand each other. Also it's a way through I which I can improve my writing skills which I feel have gotten rusty ever since I started majoring in computer science. And yes, I'm a programmer or one in the making at least. Just don't ask me for any help, I'm still a beginner myself. =)</b></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><b><br /></b></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><b>&nbsp; &nbsp;So I guess this is just a small introduction as to why I've made this blog. Hopefully, this way I'll be forced to write more and inshaAllah whatever I write will have some benefit. So no, I don't plan to write random rantings, those shall stay in head as far as I know - unless I feel a strong urge to do otherwise. (Like ranting about how adorably cute cats are and how I don't get people not liking them XD JK.)</b></span></div></div>
